# Project: Classroom Comfort Study

**Introduction**

Have you ever wondered if your classroom is the perfect place to learn? Maybe it's too hot, too cold, or too noisy. This project aims to find out by collecting data on different factors that can affect how comfortable and focused we feel in the classroom.

**What does this project do?**

Collects data: We'll use sensors or surveys to gather information about things like temperature, noise levels, and lighting.

Stores data: We'll use a database called MongoDB to store all the data in a safe and organized way. It's like a super-organized digital filing cabinet!

Visualizes data: Using HTML and JavaScript, we'll create a website to display the data in easy-to-understand graphs and charts. This will help us see patterns and trends.

**Why use MongoDB, HTML, and JavaScript?**

MongoDB: This database is super flexible, meaning we can store all kinds of different data in it. It's like a big digital box where we can put anything we want.

HTML: This is the building block of websites. It helps us create the structure of our website, like the headings, paragraphs, and images.

JavaScript: This is the programming language that makes our website interactive. It allows us to create cool features like graphs and charts that update automatically.

**How can you contribute?**

Collect data: Help us gather data by taking surveys or using sensors.

Build the website: If you have coding experience, you can help us improve the website design or add new features.

Spread the word: Tell your friends and teachers about the project and encourage them to participate.

**Getting Started**

Set up MongoDB: Follow the official MongoDB documentation to install and set up a local database.

Create an HTML file: Use a text editor to create a new HTML file and start building the structure of your website.

Add JavaScript: Write JavaScript code to fetch data from MongoDB and create visualizations.


Let's create a more comfortable learning environment together!
