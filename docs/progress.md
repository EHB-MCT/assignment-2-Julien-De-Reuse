This is my progress for this task.

1. I started by finding a purpose for this task. I explored a lot of ideas before deciding to analyze the comfort between a classroom and an auditorium.
2. Realizing it would be difficult to measure, and after discussing it with my teacher, I decided to focus on the students instead of technology. The primary goal is to assess the comfort of students, which, of course, is subjective.
3. I began changing the project to align with the right purpose.

TODO:

Create the front-end and back-end
Create dummy data in JSON
Link the database to an online database and analyze which one is the best.
