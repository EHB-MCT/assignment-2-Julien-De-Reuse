# This is my progress for this task.

1. I started by finding a purpose for this task. I explored a lot of ideas before deciding to analyze the comfort between a classroom and an auditorium.
2. Realizing it would be difficult to measure, and after discussing it with my teacher, I decided to focus on the students instead of technology. The primary goal is to assess the comfort of students, which, of course, is subjective.
3. I began changing the project to align with the right purpose.
4. I started creating a simple forms where the users could give their feeling about some topics.
5. The best way to have the same type of answer for each opinion wasn't to give the freedom for each user to write down everything they want. So I decided to use grades from 1 to 5.
6. Ones the forms is working, I linked the data to a database. I chose MongoDB because I know how to use it in a simple and easy way for my goal.
7. When I knew the database was linked to my backend I started thinking about he visualisation. I chose to make a floorplan of the school so make it obvouis its about classrooms.
8. I chose to work with SVG. In that way its easier to design a realisitic plan of the school.
9. To visualize the data, I chose to calculate for each paramater an average so it can match with a color.
